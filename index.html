<h1>You're Connected.</h1>
<p>The San Francisco Wireless Emergency Mesh (SFWEM) is a volunteer-led project to build a resilient high-speed wireless connectivity throughout the San Francisco Bay Area for use during disasters and emergencies.</p>
<p>This website provides details of on-mesh resources for use by Amateur Radio operators and served agencies, such as documentation, node configuration details and backend services like maps or NTP, and so on.</p>
<p>This site also hosts an AREDN Alert Messages (AAM) server, and an Operational Bulletins blog with eratta and other notices about the mesh.</p>
